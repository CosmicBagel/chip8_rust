# Chip8_rust

A chip 8 emulator written in rust

Currently it is minimally fuctional, but has bugs and doesn't take user input yet.

## Thanks to
- https://github.com/kripod/chip8-roms for providing a nice collection of roms to test with
- https://github.com/mattmikolay/chip-8/wiki/CHIP%E2%80%908-Technical-Reference for a really good
  starting reference
- https://ajor.co.uk/chip8/chip8.html for a nice emulator to compare behaviour against

## Building and playing

Just clone and `cargo run`

*Should* work on windows and linux

See https://github.com/kripod/chip8-roms for roms to try

¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
